/**
 * SNAP sound effects — small, satisfying audio cues for completion events.
 *
 * Sounds live in `public/sounds/`. Drop in mp3 / wav files matching the
 * names below and they'll play automatically. If a file is missing the
 * player fails silently (no console errors, no broken UX).
 *
 * Mute state is persisted in localStorage per-browser so each bookkeeper
 * controls their own. The sidebar toggle reads/writes this same key.
 *
 * Sound files expected (drop them at these paths):
 *   public/sounds/client-graduated.mp3   — Onboarding → Month-over-month
 *   public/sounds/scan-complete.mp3      — Any long-running scan finishes
 *   public/sounds/finalize-failed.mp3    — Partial or failed QBO finalize
