 * Mike, 2026-07-15 (Dominion Painters bank feed): "transaction matching,
 * payments, transfers — so that transfers and payments don't get categorized
 * as expenses or revenue." Decision: auto-route to the correct balance-sheet
 * account WHERE CONFIDENT, park the ambiguous ones for a quick review.
 *
 * "Confident" = the transaction text names exactly one of the client's own
 * balance-sheet accounts (e.g. a "PC Financial Mastercard" payment when the
 * client has a Credit Card account by that name). That single unambiguous
 * destination is safe to auto-apply. Everything else (a bare "MASTERCARD
 * PAYMENT" with two cards, a "TRANSFER TO CHECKING", any loan payment —
 * which splits principal/interest) is parked with a suggested destination.
 *
 * Shared by the one-time reclass discover pre-pass and the daily-recon
 * pre-router so both behave identically. Pure + unit-tested.
