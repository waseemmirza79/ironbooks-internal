/**
 * Vendor Knowledge Base
 * ─────────────────────
 * Pre-Claude lookup table for the ~200 most common vendors a Canadian trades
 * contractor encounters. Saves an API call per transaction match — orders of
 * magnitude faster than asking Claude, and zero cost.
 *
 * Lookup order in the reclass pipeline:
 *   1. This knowledge base (instant, no API call)
 *   2. Per-client bank_rules cache (instant DB query)
 *   3. Claude AI (batched API call)
 *   4. Web search (Claude tool use, only for low-confidence items)
 *
 * Account names returned here MUST match the master COA. Industry-specific
 * accounts (like "Job Supplies & Materials") are tagged with `industries` so they
 * only fire for matching industries.
