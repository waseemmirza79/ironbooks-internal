 * Stale-job watchdog. Auto-fails any background job that's been sitting in
 * `executing` past its watchdog window so the row doesn't rot forever and
 * block the client from starting a new run.
 *
 * Two failure modes we catch:
 *
 * 1. Never-started: status='executing', execution_started_at IS NULL,
 *    created_at older than NEVER_STARTED_MS. This is the "AI categorization
 *    or web_search hung silently" case — the worker accepted the job but
 *    crashed/timed-out before writing the first stage marker. (Interial
 *    Painting reclass, May 2026 — sat 3+ hours.)
 *
 * 2. Started-but-stalled: status='executing', execution_started_at older
 *    than STARTED_STALE_MS. The executor began the QBO write phase but
 *    crashed mid-loop without ever flipping status. Generous window so we
 *    don't kill a legitimately slow large-batch run.
 *
 * Cheap to run on every clients-page load — it's a handful of indexed
 * UPDATEs and almost always touches zero rows. Also safe to expose as a
 * cron endpoint.

//   - QBO transaction fetch on a multi-year date range: 2-5 min silent

//   - Anthropic 529 retry chain: ~14s backoff on top of 75s timeout per call
// 15 min still catches truly stuck jobs (the worker would emit at least one
// phase or progress marker within that window if it's actually doing work).
