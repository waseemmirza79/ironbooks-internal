/**
 * Per-client revenue recognition mode.
 *
 * `deposits_only` — for cash-basis clients whose field CRM (Jobber / DripJobs /
 * Housecall) pushes INVOICES into QBO. On the cash-basis P&L those invoices get
 * recognized as income, and the bank deposit that pays them is ALSO categorized
 * to a revenue account, so the same job is counted twice (Dominion Painters:
 * $1,002.58 invoice in Billable Expense Income + $1,132.91 deposit in Service
 * Revenue = the invoice net × 1.13 HST). In this mode SNAP recognizes revenue
 * from ACTUAL CASH RECEIPTS only and excludes the invoice-recognized income.
 *
 * This is the INVERSE of lib/revenue-integrity.ts (which treats the invoice as
 * truth and the deposit as the duplicate — the Clean Your Carpets case). Which
 * leg is real is a per-client policy: `revenue_recognition_mode` on client_links.
 *
 * Pure + dependency-free — fixture-tested. Consumed by monthly production
 * (statement P&L) and the close-verification gate.
