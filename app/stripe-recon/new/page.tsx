  // break their close-out. The form annotates completed clients in the
  // dropdown so it's obvious.
  // Exclude clients flagged as "doesn't use Stripe" — the entire
  // recon flow is suppressed for them. (Bookkeepers can re-enable from
  // the comms-tracker on the client card if circumstances change.)
