/**
 * POST /api/portal/support — client portal support ticket submission.
 *
 * Submitted from the floating Help widget in app/portal/support-widget.tsx.
 * Two-track delivery so a ticket is never silently lost:
 *
 *   1. Email via Resend HTTP API → admin@ironbooks.com (the destination
 *      Mike asked for). Uses raw fetch against api.resend.com to avoid
 *      pulling in another SDK dependency. Requires RESEND_API_KEY env
 *      var; if absent we log loudly and rely on the audit_log fallback.
 *      The `from` address defaults to Resend's onboarding sender so
 *      tickets ship immediately even before a custom domain is verified
 *      — Mike can override with SUPPORT_FROM_EMAIL once ironbooks.com
 *      domain auth is set up in Resend.
 *
 *   2. audit_log row (event_type=portal_support_ticket) — durable,
 *      queryable from /admin/audit. Always written, regardless of email
 *      outcome. Doubles as a triage queue if email delivery breaks.
 *
 * Auth: must be inside a resolved portal context (real client OR admin
 * impersonating). Internal users not impersonating can't submit — they
 * have other tools.
 *
 * Note: we send a single email per request — no rate limiting yet because
 * (a) submission is gated to authenticated portal users, (b) tickets are
 * already throttled by human typing speed. Add rate limiting if spam
 * becomes an issue.
