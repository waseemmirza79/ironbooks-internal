/**
 * GET /api/rules/export-qbo/[client_link_id]
 *
 * Returns an .xls file in QBO's exact "Export Rules" format so the
 * bookkeeper can upload it via QBO's Banking → Rules → ⋮ → Import Rules
 * flow. This is the workaround for QBO's public API not supporting
 * /bankrule POSTs (every attempt returns "Unsupported Operation").
 *
 * Format reverse-engineered from a real QBO export
 * (Painter_Growth_Ventures_Ltd__Bank_Feed_Rules.xls):
 *
 *   - Single sheet named "Worksheet"
 *   - 3 columns: "Rule Name" | "Rule Conditions" | "Rule Outputs"
 *   - Conditions + Outputs are JSON strings with numeric ruleType /
 *     actionType codes
 *   - Categories use account NAME (parent:child format), NOT internal
 *     QBO IDs — meaning we can write target_account_name straight
 *     through without resolving against the target QBO file
 *
 * Before building the file, we ensure every target account referenced by
 * these rules actually EXISTS in the client's live QBO chart (creating any
 * master-COA account that's missing, additive-only — same primitive as
 * /admin/apply-master-coa). Mike, 2026-07-15: QBO's own "Upload list"
 * import wizard tries to auto-match each row's category text against the
 * live COA and falls back to a blank "Select category" dropdown whenever
 * no matching account exists yet — which was every row for a brand-new
 * category (Job Supplies & Materials, Parking, Small Tools, Permit Fees on
 * Dominion Painters). Creating the account first means the exact name is
 * live in QBO by the time the file lands in the wizard, so it auto-selects.
 *
 * Action type codes:
 *   0  = category (account name)
 *   1  = memo
 *   4  = tax code
 *   5  = payee
 *   7  = (numeric, observed but undocumented — class? location?)
 *   8  = auto-add boolean
 *   11 = (always [] in samples)
 *
 * Condition type codes:
 *   1  = description contains
 *   10 = transaction sign ("-1" = money out / expense, "1" = money in)
