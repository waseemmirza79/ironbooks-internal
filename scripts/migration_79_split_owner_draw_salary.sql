-- Migration 79 — Split "Owner Draw / Salary" into two Master COA accounts
-- =========================================================================
-- Owner compensation has two different treatments and must not be conflated:
--   • Owner's Payroll → operating EXPENSE (above net profit, a fixed cost)
--   • Owner's Draw           → EQUITY (below net profit; a distribution, NOT an expense)
--
-- The template previously had a single combined "Owner Draw / Salary" expense
-- account. This renames it to the owner payroll expense and adds a separate
-- equity "Owner's Draw" account for every jurisdiction it existed in.
--
-- Run in Supabase SQL editor:
-- https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/omzobviyhrgiqywfjzwo/sql/new

-- 1) Rename the combined account → the salary/wages EXPENSE (stays an expense).
update master_coa
set account_name = 'Owner''s Payroll',
    notes = 'Owner on payroll — operating expense (fixed cost), above the net-profit line. Distinct from Owner''s Draw (equity).',
    updated_at = now()
where account_name = 'Owner Draw / Salary';

-- 2) Add the EQUITY "Owner's Draw" account for each jurisdiction/industry that
--    had the combined account — copying jurisdiction/industry/sort from it.
--    Idempotent: skip if an Owner's Draw already exists for that scope.
